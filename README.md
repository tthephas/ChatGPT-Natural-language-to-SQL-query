# ChatGPT-Natural-language-to-SQL-query

Uses API with ChatGPT to allow users to run SQL queries using natural language

For example, a user could ask "give me sales totals from the year 2004" and the program will use chatGPT to change that wording into a sql query, query the database (used pandas to bring in csv data) and give a result as if an analyst ran the sql query

Used Python, Pandas, sqlalchemy, openAI API/ChatGPT
